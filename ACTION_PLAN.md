- [ ] Fix warning in auspost.c about main() return type
- [ ] Add type hints to Python code
- [x] Add proper error handling
- [x] Add logging
- [ ] Add documentation strings to all functions
- [ ] Update Python code to use modern features:
  - [ ] Use Pathlib for file operations
  - [ ] Add proper type annotations
  - [ ] Use modern context managers
  - [ ] Add dataclasses for structured data

## Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure ðŸš§

- [x] Add basic test structure
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite:
  - [x] Basic barcode generation test
  - [ ] Test different FCC values (11, 59, 62)
  - [ ] Test DPID edge cases
  - [ ] Test customer value variations
  - [ ] Test error cases
  - [ ] Test image generation options
- [ ] Add test fixtures
- [ ] Add test data

  - [ ] CLI usage
- [ ] Add changelog

## Phase 7: Security

- [ ] Add security scanning
- [ ] Add dependency auditing
- [ ] Add code signing
- [ ] Add security documentation
- [ ] Add SECURITY.md file

## Phase 8: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Profile C extension
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
- [ ] Add caching where appropriate
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

## Phase 9: Platform Support

- [x] Test on macOS
- [ ] Test on Linux
- [ ] Test on Windows
- [ ] Add platform-specific optimizations
- [ ] Document platform requirements
- [ ] Add platform-specific build instructions

## Phase 10: Release Preparation

- [ ] Version bump
- [ ] Update changelog
- [ ] Test release process
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Publish to PyPI
- [ ] Announce release

## Notes

- Each phase can be worked on independently
- Phases can be reordered based on priority
- Some tasks might need to be revisited as the project evolves
- Regular testing should be done throughout the process
- Documentation should be updated as changes are made

## Current Focus ðŸŽ¯

1. Complete the testing infrastructure:

   - Add more test cases for different scenarios
   - Set up test coverage reporting

2. Fix remaining code issues:

   - Fix the main() return type warning in auspost.c
   - Add type hints to Python code
   - Complete documentation strings

3. Set up pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality
